Approach.

get food item, weight for each. make the app to show in the order of carbs, pro, veg1, veg2

weight = [100, 40, 40, 40] in grams
then load cell gets "current weight"

i=0
while i< len.weight
    if current weight > weight[i]
        then turn LED on 
        delay(2000)
        turn LED off
        i +=1
